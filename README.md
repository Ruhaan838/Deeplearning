# Deep Learning Project: 🖼️ Image Classification, 🎨 Image Segmentation, and 🕵️‍♂️ Object Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project focusing on image classification, segmentation, and object detection tasks.

## Introduction 🧑‍💻

In this project, we utilize deep learning techniques to address three fundamental computer vision tasks:

1. **Image Classification**: Assigning a label or category to an input image.
2. **Image Segmentation**: Partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions.
3. **Object Detection**: Identifying and locating objects within an image.

## Structure 🛠️

The repository is structured as follows:

- **/classification**: Contains code of image classification.
- **/segmentation**: Contains code of image segmentation.
- **/object_detection**: Contains code of object detection.
